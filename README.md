# Desciption

**MistralChatBotUpdated** is a ChatBot that uses Streamlit as the GUI and [Mistral API](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/) as the LLM.  There are many exemples outthere but some os them use the 0.4.2 mistralai library. So, I'm building one more to update the librarys.

Some exemples, out there:

- [Build an AI Chatbot with MistralAI + Streamlit](Build an AI Chatbot with MistralAI + Streamlit
)

- [How to build AI ChatBots with Mistral and Llama2](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/how-to-build-ai-chatbots-with-mistral-and-llama2)
