# Desciption

MinistralChat is a ChatBot that uses Streamlit as the GUI and Ministral API as the Agent.  

### Motivation

There are many exemples outthere but some os them use the 0.4.2 mistralai library. So, I'm building one more to update the librarys.

## Requirements


## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
